## Introduction
The world of cryptocurrency trading is dynamic and requires real-time information sharing. This project implements a **Publish-Subscribe Cryptocurrency Dealing Room System** using Java to solve the problem of indirect communication in distributed trading systems. The system enables multiple users to **publish** and **subscribe** to cryptocurrency updates in real time, leveraging Javaâ€™s advanced APIs for distributed systems.

### Key Features:
- **Publish-Subscribe Communication Model**
- **Real-time Cryptocurrency Updates**
- **Centralized Login System** for security
- **GUI for User-Friendliness**
- **Multi-threaded Architecture** for handling concurrent users

---

## System Overview
The system is based on three main components:
1. **Publisher** - Provides cryptocurrency updates.
2. **Subscriber** - Receives real-time updates on chosen cryptocurrencies.
3. **Dealing Room Server** - Acts as a central bulletin board for message distribution.

The Dealing Room Server ensures that **publishers post updates**, and **subscribers receive only the relevant updates**, allowing for **efficient, real-time, and decoupled communication** in a trading environment.

---

## Data Structures and Algorithms
### Key Data Structures Used:
- **HashMap** - Stores user credentials, subscriptions, and cryptocurrency updates.
- **ConcurrentHashMap** - Ensures thread-safe access to active connections.
- **ArrayList** - Maintains dynamic lists of articles and subscribed users.
- **Set** - Ensures uniqueness in subscriptions and prevents duplicates.

These data structures provide **fast lookups**, **scalability**, and **efficient handling of dynamic user actions**.

## Problem Solving - Dealing Room Server
### Challenges and Solutions:
1. **Handling Real-time Crypto Updates:**
   - Solution: A `HashMap<String, ArrayList<CryptoObject>>` structure stores updates and distributes them efficiently.
2. **Managing User Subscriptions:**
   - Solution: A `SubscriptionList` (`HashMap<String, Set<String>>`) maps topics to users, allowing easy addition/removal of subscribers.
3. **Efficient Client Communication:**
   - Solution: A `clientOutputStreams` map keeps track of active connections for instant message delivery.
4. **Persisting Data for Recovery:**
   - Solution: Subscription lists and crypto articles are periodically saved to files to ensure resilience against server restarts.

## Problem Solving - Client
### Key Functionalities:
1. **User Authentication:** Secure login system differentiates between publishers and subscribers.
2. **Crypto Article Publishing:** Publishers can input new cryptocurrency news updates.
3. **Subscription Management:** Subscribers can dynamically subscribe/unsubscribe to topics.
4. **GUI Interface:** A user-friendly UI simplifies interactions with the system.
5. **Error Handling:** Supports network reconnections and informs users of connection issues.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- **Java 8+** installed
- A **networked environment** for distributed communication

### Steps
1. **Start the Dealing Room Server:**
```sh
java DealingRoomServer
```
2. **Start a CryptoPublisherClient:**
```sh
java CryptoPublisherClient
```
3. **Login/Register** and begin publishing/subscribing to cryptocurrency updates.
